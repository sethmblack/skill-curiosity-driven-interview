# Curiosity-Driven Interview

Move conversations past surface-level exchanges to genuine depth by using authentic curiosity, probing follow-up questions, and connecting responses to larger patterns. This skill transforms interviews from surface-level exchanges into genuine conversations that reveal authentic experience. The key insight: rehearsed narratives ("I just worked hard and got lucky") contain truth but hide the interesting parts. Curiosity probes find the moments of near-failure, the unsexy reasons for persistence, the actual psychology beneath the polished story. "I'm going to push back because everyone says 'hard work and luck' but there's probably more to it." The technique requires genuine curiosity (not performed interest), willingness to share your own experience, and respect for boundaries when someone doesn't want to go deeper.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use interview techniques for interrogation or coercion
- Push past boundaries when someone clearly doesn't want to go deeper
- Weaponize disclosed information against the person
- Pretend curiosity that's actually judgment

**If asked to extract information harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. This skill is for connection and understanding, not extraction.

## When to Use

- Podcast or media interviews
- One-on-one conversations where you want depth
- When you sense there's a more interesting story beneath the surface
- When someone gives a pat or rehearsed answer
- Any conversation that feels surface-level but could go deeper

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Topic | Yes | What you're discussing or exploring |
| Initial response | Yes | The answer you've received that you want to dig beneath |
| Your genuine question | Yes | What you're actually curious about (not what sounds good) |
| Relevant personal experience | No | Connection from your own life that demonstrates understanding |

## Core Principle

Don't ask what sounds like a good question. Ask what you genuinely want to know. The best interviews happen when both people drop their defenses. You lower yours first through admitted uncertainty and genuine interest. The questions that matter are the ones you actually want answered, not the ones that sound impressive.

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Notice the Surface Answer

Pay attention to:
- Rehearsed-sounding narratives
- "Eureka moment" stories (sudden revelation without process)
- Generic explanations that could apply to anyone
- Answers that feel too clean or complete

**Signal:** If it sounds like something they've said a hundred times, there's probably more underneath.

### Step 2: Find Your Genuine Curiosity

Ask yourself:
- What am I actually curious about here?
- What doesn't quite add up?
- What would I want to know if this were a friend, not an interview subject?
- What's the psychology driving this behavior?

**Key:** Don't ask what sounds like a good question. Ask what you genuinely want to know.

### Step 3: Deploy the Curiosity Probe

Structure your follow-up:
1. **Acknowledge what they said** - Show you heard them
2. **Express genuine confusion or curiosity** - "But wait..."
3. **Ask the specific question** - Target the gap or simplification
4. **Offer your own experience** - Create space by being vulnerable

**Template:** "That makes sense, but I'm curious - when you say you 'just decided' to [X], what was actually happening? Like, was there a moment of breakdown first? Because my own changes have all come from rock bottom, not revelation."

### Step 4: Follow the Thread

When they give a deeper answer:
- Ask the follow-up to the follow-up
- Connect their answer to patterns you've observed
- Relate it to your own experience (briefly)
- Use question-answer-question chains

**Example chain:** "Why would someone do that? Maybe they're insecure? But that seems too simple, right? Like, what's underneath the insecurity?"

### Step 5: Acknowledge What You Don't Know

Throughout the conversation:
- Admit when you're out of your depth
- Say when the person knows more than you
- Note when you might be wrong
- Make space for correction

**Template:** "I might be completely off here, but..." or "You know way more about this than I do, so tell me if I'm wrong..."

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Deeper response | Movement from surface narrative to authentic experience |
| Connection | Shared understanding between interviewer and subject |
| Insight | Patterns, psychology, or meaning revealed through conversation |
| Trust | Established safety for ongoing honesty |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person clams up | Back off. Return to easier territory. Try a different angle later. |
| You realize you're pushing too hard | Name it: "I realize I'm digging and you might not want to go there. We can move on." |
| Your curiosity is actually judgment | Check yourself. Reframe. Find genuine interest. |
| Person gives another surface answer | Try one more probe. If they still deflect, respect the boundary. |
| You don't have relevant personal experience | Be honest about that too: "I haven't been through this, so I'm genuinely trying to understand." |

## Example

**Context:** Interviewing someone about their career success.

**Surface answer:** "I just worked hard and got lucky."

**Generic follow-up:** "Can you tell me more about that luck?"

**Curiosity-Driven follow-up:**

"Okay, but - and I'm going to push back a little here because I've interviewed a lot of successful people and they all say 'hard work and luck,' which is probably true, but it's also probably not the whole story.

What I'm curious about is: was there a moment when you almost quit? Because I've noticed that most people have a story about when they almost bailed, and something specific kept them in. For me, I almost quit acting after ten years of failed auditions. What kept me was honestly ego and stubbornness more than any noble belief in myself.

Was there a version of that for you? The unsexy truth about why you stuck with it?"

**Result:** Moving from polished narrative to the actual psychology of persistence.

## Constraints

- This skill requires genuine curiosity—if you're not actually interested, it will read as technique
- Respect boundaries—some people don't want to go deep, and that's information, not failure
- Be willing to be corrected—part of curiosity is admitting you might be wrong
- This is conversation, not interrogation—the goal is mutual understanding, not extraction
- Never push past boundaries when someone clearly doesn't want to go deeper
- Never weaponize disclosed information against the person

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Performed Curiosity** | Asking questions that sound good without actually wanting answers. People sense the falseness. | Ask what you genuinely want to know, even if it sounds less impressive. |
| **Interrogation Mode** | Pushing relentlessly for depth without creating safety. | Share your own experience first. Create space by being vulnerable. |
| **Ignoring Boundaries** | Continuing to probe when someone has signaled discomfort. | One more gentle probe, then respect the deflection. |
| **Question Dumping** | Asking multiple questions without processing answers. | Follow up on what they said before asking something new. |
| **Judgment Disguised** | Pretending curiosity when you actually want to criticize. | Check your real motivation. If it's judgment, reframe or don't ask. |
